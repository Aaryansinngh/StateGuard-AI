# StateGuard-AI

StateGuard-AI is a simple AI model verification framework that uses
state space exploration to verify safety properties of AI models.

## Features

- Exhaustive state space exploration
- Safety property checking
- Counterexample generation
- JSON violation reporting

## How It Works

1. Generate all possible input states
2. Run AI model on each state
3. Check safety property
4. Store violations

## Run

python main.py
=======


StateGuard-AI is a modular verification framework designed to validate AI decision systems using explicit state space exploration. 

The system models AI behavior as a deterministic function over a bounded input domain and systematically checks predefined safety properties. If violations are detected, counterexamples are automatically generated and stored for analysis.

This project demonstrates how formal verification concepts can be applied to AI systems to improve reliability and safety.
