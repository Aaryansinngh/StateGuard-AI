StateGuard-AI is a modular verification framework designed to validate AI decision systems using explicit state space exploration. 

The system models AI behavior as a deterministic function over a bounded input domain and systematically checks predefined safety properties. If violations are detected, counterexamples are automatically generated and stored for analysis.

This project demonstrates how formal verification concepts can be applied to AI systems to improve reliability and safety.
# StateGuard-AIA lightweight AI verification framework using bounded state space exploration to detect safety property violations and generate counterexamples.
